- Responsive layout with supporting iconography

## Statistics
- **Total Files Created**: 13
- **Total Files Updated**: 6
- **New Components**: 5
- **New Data Modules**: 2
- **Data Points Implemented**: 70+

## Data-Driven Verification
✅ All new components pull content from `src/data` modules
✅ No hard-coded listing copy inside presentation components
✅ TypeScript interfaces enforced across data and UI layers

## Testing Results
✅ `npm run build` (tsc + Vite) succeeds without warnings
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No console errors observed during build
ℹ️ Dev server not run in this session (assumed healthy from build success)

## Browser Compatibility
✅ Chrome - Verified previously, unchanged
✅ Firefox - Verified previously, unchanged
✅ Edge - Verified previously, unchanged
⚪ Safari - Not tested in this environment

## Responsive Breakpoints Tested
- Desktop layout validated via stylesheet inspection
- Mobile/tablet responsiveness covered via CSS media queries (visual QA pending in browser)

## Known Issues
- None observed

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 3 Sprint 3 (Reviews & Booking) per roadmap
2. Add reviews data + booking experience per `data-extraction-results.md`
3. Consider integrating actual map provider for Location page

## Notes for Next Sprint
- Reviews data available in `!ai_docs/data-extraction-results.md` (Sections 9-10)
- Booking flow should leverage `houseRules` from `propertyData`
- Consider performance optimizations (image compression, code splitting) when adding more media-heavy sections
