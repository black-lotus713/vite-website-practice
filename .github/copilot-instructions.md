## Project Snapshot
- React 19 + TypeScript SPA generated by Vite (`src/main.tsx`) for Pelican's Place branding; strict TS config + flat ESLint enforce clean imports and no implicit anys.
- Routing bootstraps in `src/App.tsx` (`BrowserRouter`) and all screens live under `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`; Layout + Header/Footer wrap every page.
- Data is static/curated from `!ai_docs/*.md`; treat those docs as source-of-truth when updating copy or numbers.
- Target hosting is Netlify; `netlify.toml` already wires build (`npm run build`) and SPA rewrite.

## Architecture & Navigation
- Component tree is split by purpose: `components/layout` (chrome), `components/pages` (route-level), `components/features` (home-only sections), `components/ui` (reusable cards/forms).
- New pages should extend `AppRoutes`, update nav definitions in `components/layout/Header.tsx` + `MobileMenu.tsx`, and reuse `components/pages/PageStyles.css` for shared spacing.
- Layout renders `<Outlet />` between `Header` and `Footer`; large structural CSS lives in `Layout.css`, `App.css`, and `src/index.css`.
- Internal links should use `react-router-dom`'s `Link`/`NavLink` for SPA navigation; plain `<a>` is reserved for external URLs (Airbnb, social, etc.).

## Data & Content Sources
- Typed domain models live in `src/types/index.ts`; data modules in `src/data` export both raw objects and selector helpers (`getHighlights`, `getHouseRules`, etc.)—prefer the helpers to keep coupling low.
- `propertyImages.ts` consumes `propertyImages.manifest.json` and serves `/public/gallery` assets; run `npm run download:images` to sync new entries via `scripts/download-images.mjs`.
- `reviews.ts`, `amenities.ts`, `propertyData.ts`, and `bookingData.ts` mirror Airbnb extracts from `!ai_docs/data-extraction-results.md`; align edits with those docs or refresh them first.
- Contact metadata and limits come from `contactConfig.ts`; keep sensitive values (emails/endpoints) there rather than inside UI components.

## UI & Utility Patterns
- `components/ui` houses composable pieces (e.g., `ContactForm`, `CalendarWidget`, `HouseRulesCard`, `ReviewCard`) each with a paired CSS file—styles are global, so follow the existing BEM-ish naming to avoid clashes.
- Icons are centralized via `react-icons`; when data stores icon names (e.g., `propertyData.highlights`), map strings to actual components (`PropertyHighlights.tsx`) instead of storing JSX.
- Form + FAQ logic relies on utilities: `utils/contactUtils.ts` handles validation/sanitization and `utils/faqUtils.ts` derives FAQs from `propertyData.houseRules`.
- Booking flows (`BookPage.tsx`) share calendar helpers from `utils/calendarUtils.ts` so date formatting and validation stay consistent across widgets.

## Developer Workflows
- Install: `npm install` (Node 24.11.1+). Dev server: `npm run dev` on `http://localhost:5173`. Type check + bundle: `npm run build` (runs `tsc -b` before Vite).
- Quality: `npm run lint` uses the flat config in `eslint.config.js`; fix warnings before committing to keep CI-ready.
- Preview prod output with `npm run preview`. Use `npm run download:images` whenever `propertyImages.manifest.json` changes to pull remote assets locally.
- `react-calendar` ships its own stylesheet; `CalendarWidget.tsx` imports it once, so avoid duplicate imports elsewhere.

## Deployment & Hosting
- Netlify dev/build commands are defined in `netlify.toml`; local dev parity via `netlify dev` is optional but matches `npm run dev`.
- SPA routing depends on the `/* -> /index.html` redirect; keep it intact when editing deployment settings.
- Static assets under `public/` (logo, gallery images) are copied verbatim; reference them with absolute paths (`/gallery/...`) so Netlify serves them correctly.

## When Adding Features
- Favor updating `src/data/*.ts` and selectors over hard-coding copy in components; many UI sections (Hero, Contact, Reviews, Amenities) read directly from those modules.
- If content stems from Airbnb research, refresh the relevant file under `!ai_docs/` and then sync the mirrored TS data to maintain provenance.
- Keep new components typed and colocate CSS in the same folder; respect the project-wide practice of importing `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions explicitly (`import App from './App.tsx`).
- For integrations (forms, booking links), thread configurable values through `contactConfig`, `bookingData`, or environment variables rather than embedding secrets in JSX.
